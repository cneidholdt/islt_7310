<h1>Welcome to my Website</h1>
<p> Again, my name is Carley Neidholdt. I was born and raised in
    <b>Keytesville</b>, MO which is where I graduated high school. I am a first year 
    teacher teaching Kindergarten at a local Catholic school. I am 22 years old 
    and recently engaged. I received my Associates of Arts Degree at Moberly 
    Area Community College. I am currently studying to receive my Bachelor of 
    Science Degree specializing in <em>Elementary</em> Education. I am currently studying 
    at the University of Missouri (online) for the time being. That will soon 
    change as I canâ€™t get my degree online in this program. My estimated 
    completion date is the summer of 2023. Considering I am teaching full time it
     is taking me a little longer to graduate.</p>
